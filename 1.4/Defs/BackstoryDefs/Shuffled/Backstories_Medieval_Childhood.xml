    <description>Despite not being of noble blood, [PAWN_nameDef] was taken on as a squire by a kind and chivalrous knight. The knight spent very little time at court, preferring to wander the kingdom helping others, [PAWN_nameDef] ever at his side. [PAWN_nameDef] gained an appreciation for adventure, travel, and aiding those in need, and resolved to see [PAWN_possessive] training as a knight through so that [PAWN_pronoun] could continue to do so.</description>

    <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was the illegitimate child of a nobleman, the result of an affair with a comely maid. In exchange for being discreet, [PAWN_nameDef]’s mother received a modest allowance, which she used to rent comfortable lodgings for herself and her child. [PAWN_nameDef] eventually began to develop an interest in the arts, and [PAWN_possessive] father increased the allowance in order to pay for an art tutor.</description>
